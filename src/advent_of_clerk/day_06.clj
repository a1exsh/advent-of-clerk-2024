;; We are going to use `get-in` and similar to access the board cells at
;; coordinates `[y x]`.
;;
;; First we need to be able to find the guard's position and direction:
;;
(defn find-guard [board]
  (->> board
       (map-indexed (fn [y row]
                      (->> row
                           (map-indexed (fn [x c]
                                          [[y x] c])))))
       (apply concat)
       (filter (fn [[_ c]]
                 (some #{c} directions))) ; NB: checking all directions
       (map (fn [[pos c]] {:pos pos :dir c}))
       first))

(def guard (find-guard puzzle))

;;
;; To avoid confusion in case the guard stumbles upon her own initial position
;; we denote it as an empty space:
;;
(def clean-board (assoc-in puzzle (guard :pos) \.))

;; For each direction, define the next move's dy and dx:
(def dir->dyx
  {\^ [-1  0]
   \> [ 0  1]
   \v [ 1  0]
   \< [ 0 -1]})

;; And the next direction in case we have to turn:
(def next-dir
  {\^ \>
   \> \v
   \v \<
   \< \^})

;;
;; Now, given the current state of the board, including the guard's position
;; `[y x]` and direction `dir`, we should be able to derive the state of the
;; board after one move, according to the rules.
;;
(defn move-guard [board {:keys [pos dir]}]
  (let [[y x]   pos
        [dy dx] (dir->dyx dir)
        next-pos [(+ y dy) (+ x dx)]
        c (get-in board next-pos)]
    (case c
      nil nil                                 ; gone
      \#  {:pos pos      :dir (next-dir dir)} ; blocked, turn
      \.  {:pos next-pos :dir dir}            ; free, move there
      (throw (Exception. (format "Something unexpected found: %c" c))))))

;; ## Part I

;; Finally, we are ready to move the guard a step, or two:
(def path
  (->> guard
       (iterate (partial move-guard clean-board))
       (take-while #(not (nil? %)))))

(->> path
     (map :pos)
     distinct
     count)
